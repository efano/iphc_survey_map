# MAP673 Final Map Project Expectations and Schedule

MAP673, and the New Maps Plus Certificate, culminates in an independent project of substantial work and quality. The goal of this final project is threefold:

1. challenge you to synthesize a range of technical and conceptual knowledge gained throughout the New Maps Plus courses to produce a novel and effective web map
2. provide you with a chance to procure your own data relating to a meaning topic of your choosing, and in doing so allow you to explore and experiment with additional mapping techniques not covered within course lessons
3. give you a strong portfolio piece celebrating your skills and demonstrating your talent to employers, potential clients, and the wider geospatial community

Given the right amount of effort, these maps will be competitive in national and international student interactive mapping competitions, including the [CaGIS Map Design Competition](http://www.cartogis.org/awards/contest.php) and [NACIS Student Dynamic Map Competition](http://nacis.org/awards/student-dynamic-map-competition/).

The final map will count for 35 points (35% of your entire grade for the course).

* **November 27th:** Map proposal.
* **December 4th:** Working prototype of map complete
* **December 11th:** Beta version of map complete, live-version hosted on remote, and presentations available
* **December 18th:**  Final Map submitted and portfolio updated

## Description of deliverables

We're dedicating five weeks to building and refining a final map project. The first two weeks will be more preparation for the design and development of the map, and will be done in conjunction with two slightly smaller weekly lessons/labs (D3.js and CartoDB.js). The final three weeks of the course will be dedicated solely to the final map project.

### Overview of topic (week 06)

Includes:

* description of data topic (with an anticipated map title)
* map objectives
* user needs articulated through a persona/scenario
* data sources

### Map proposal  (week 07)

Includes deliverables submitted with week 06, and additionally includes:  

* identification of anticipate thematic representation (e.g., dot map, choropleth, prop symbols, etc)
* a content and requirements list (see Module 05)
* description of the anticipated user interaction (UI)
* a series of low fidelity wireframes, paper prototypes, or mockups

### Working prototype  (week 08)

By the end of week eight we should have a working (alpha) prototype that minimally accomplishes:

* the loading of correctly formatted data into the map
* the thematic/cartographic representation of these data in a visual form
* a functional script allowing for (at least some of) the interaction routines to be completed

This prototype should be considered alpha stage. Bugs and design flaws are expected.

### Beta version and presentations (week 09)

By the end of week nine we should have a fully functional and mostly polished map to share with the class for peer review/critique. This map should be hosted in its own repository, with which a gh-pages branch can be used to share a web hosted version with the class.

Additionally, you're required to record a 5 minute presentation of your map and upload to Canvas for sharing. There are many free/open source screen casting video software options out there, but consider [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) or [Jing](https://www.techsmith.com/jing.html).

The presentation should cover the following:

* **min 1**: Introduce your topic and your motivation for the project.
* **min 2**: Briefly describe your target user, their goals and objectives for using the map.
* **mins 3 - 4**: Walk us through a live use case scenario using the map. Explain the various interface components and how the user will use them.
* **min 5**: Conclude with any features, functionality, or design aspects you'd like to attend to or improve upon for the final week (a "wish list").


### Final map submission and portfolio updated (week 10)

The instructor will assign small teams (3 - 4) to offer peer critique of your map and give you feedback (i.e., a form of mock "user testing"). Student peers should provide this feedback to other team members by Friday at the latest, to allow for time to incorporate suggestions over the weekend.

The final map will be updated and submitted, and online portfolios (from MAP672) will be updated with this map and a couple more from MAP673.
